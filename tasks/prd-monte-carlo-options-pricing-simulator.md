# Product Requirements Document: Monte Carlo-Based Options Pricing Simulator

## Introduction/Overview

The Monte Carlo-Based Options Pricing Simulator is a new feature that will be integrated into the existing Finviz Stock Scraper application. This tool uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the fair value of weekly options on highly liquid stocks and compares those values against market prices to identify potentially underpriced trading opportunities.

The simulator will help retail and semi-professional traders, quantitative analysts, and portfolio managers identify statistical arbitrage opportunities in weekly options with a focus on risk-adjusted returns.

## Goals

1. **Identify Underpriced Options**: Detect weekly options that are statistically underpriced compared to their Monte Carlo fair value
2. **Risk Assessment**: Provide comprehensive risk metrics including probability of profit, breakeven analysis, and expected payoffs
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Create an intuitive web-based interface integrated with the existing Finviz scraper dashboard
4. **Performance**: Process full weekly option chains in under 1 minute with 10,000 simulation paths
5. **Data Management**: Implement robust data caching and watchlist management for Monte Carlo candidates

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
- **As a trader**, I want to analyze weekly options using Monte Carlo simulation so that I can identify statistically underpriced opportunities
- **As a user**, I want to create and manage watchlists of stocks for Monte Carlo analysis so that I can track my preferred candidates
- **As a trader**, I want to see comprehensive ranking metrics (underpricing %, risk-reward, probability of profit) so that I can make informed trading decisions
- **As a user**, I want to configure my preferred underpricing threshold so that I can customize my opportunity detection criteria

### Secondary User Stories
- **As a user**, I want to export simulation results so that I can perform further analysis in external tools
- **As a user**, I want to see when data was last updated so that I can ensure I'm working with current information
- **As a user**, I want clear error messages when simulations fail so that I can understand what went wrong

### 5. Market vs Simulated Pricing Comparison
5.1. The system must compare current market prices with simulated fair values
5.2. The system must highlight underpriced options based on user-configurable threshold
5.3. The system must rank opportunities by multiple metrics:
   - Percentage underpricing
   - Risk-reward ratio
   - Probability of profit
5.4. The system must display all ranking factors in a single comprehensive view

### 6. User Configuration
6.1. The system must allow users to set underpricing threshold (default: user-configurable)
6.2. The system must allow users to configure strike range percentage (default: ±10%)
6.3. The system must allow users to save their preferred settings
6.4. The system must allow users to adjust simulation parameters (number of paths, time horizon)

### 7. Data Export
7.1. The system must allow users to export results as CSV
7.2. The system must allow users to export results as Excel
7.3. The system must include all simulation metrics in exports

### 8. Error Handling
8.1. The system must gracefully handle missing options data from yfinance
8.2. The system must handle missing implied volatility data
8.3. The system must provide clear error messages when simulations fail
8.4. The system must continue processing other options when individual simulations fail

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Multi-leg strategy simulation (spreads, straddles)
- Delta-hedging simulation
- Real-time data feeds (end-of-day data only for MVP)
- Execution integration (no trade placement)
- Put options analysis (calls only for MVP)
- Advanced Greeks calculations
- Volatility surface visualization
- Email/Telegram alerts (Phase 2 feature)
- Multi-leg option strategies

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements
- **New Tab Integration**: Add as a new tab in the existing Finviz scraper dashboard
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the interface works on desktop and tablet devices
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Maintain consistency with existing dashboard theme
- **Loading States**: Show progress indicators during simulation runs
- **Data Tables**: Sortable tables for results with all metrics visible
- **Watchlist Management**: Intuitive interface for creating and managing watchlists

### Navigation Structure
- **Monte Carlo Tab**: Main analysis interface
- **Watchlists Sub-tab**: Watchlist management
- **Results Sub-tab**: Simulation results and rankings
- **Settings Sub-tab**: User configuration and preferences

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Extend existing Flask web application
- **Backend**: Python 3.10+ with existing Flask framework
- **Libraries**: numpy, pandas, scipy for Monte Carlo simulations
- **Data Source**: yfinance for options data
- **Storage**: Extend existing SQLite database for watchlists and results
- **Caching**: Local file-based caching for option chain data

### Performance Requirements
- Process full weekly option chain in < 1 minute
- Support 10+ strikes per stock
- Handle 10,000 simulation paths efficiently
- Cache option data for 1-hour refresh intervals

### Database Schema Extensions
- **watchlists** table: id, name, user_id, created_at
- **watchlist_tickers** table: watchlist_id, ticker_symbol, added_at
- **simulation_results** table: ticker, option_symbol, simulation_data, created_at
- **user_preferences** table: user_id, underpricing_threshold, strike_range, other_settings

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: 95% of simulations complete within 1 minute
2. **Accuracy**: Simulated prices within ±5% of theoretical Black-Scholes values (validation)
3. **User Engagement**: 80% of users create at least one watchlist within first week
4. **Data Quality**: 90% of option chains successfully fetched and processed
5. **Error Rate**: <5% simulation failures due to data issues

## Open Questions

1. **User Authentication**: Should watchlists be user-specific or shared across all users?
2. **Historical Analysis**: Should we store historical simulation results for trend analysis?
3. **Advanced Filters**: Should we add filters for volume, open interest, or other option metrics?
4. **Batch Processing**: Should users be able to run simulations on entire watchlists at once?
5. **Alert System**: What specific conditions should trigger alerts in Phase 2?
